# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you put things in the right category!
2. Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.



### Projects using Quasar

Make sure you put things in the right category.
Specify which Quasar version u're using, if it's opensource, if it's a website or mobile app or electron app, and add a link.

#### Apps/Websites

Apps/Websites gives the opportunity to showcase the awesome things we can build with Quasar.
You should put your app/website in this category if the following conditions are true:
- The app/website is available without errors or ssl certificate problems, and load in a reasonable amount of time.
- The app/website has been created with Quasar.
- The app/website is original and not too simple.
